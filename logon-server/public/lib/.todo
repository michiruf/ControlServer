Move compilable stuff into
* /app/assets/javascripts
* /app/assets/stylesheets -> less
to reduce traffic and (I hope so) to be minified

Since this did not work immediately, just go on with other stuff...
By that, the gradle/sbt stuff for webjars was disabled

Alternatively use as much as possible cdn stuff!
