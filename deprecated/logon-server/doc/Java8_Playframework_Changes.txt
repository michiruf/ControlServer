1. Download the latest (tried with 3.18.0 and 3.18.2) javassist from  https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist/releases
2. Place it in play-1.2.7\framework\lib
3. Replace the dependency in play-1.2.7\framework\dependencies.yml:
     org.javassist -> javassist 3.9.0.GA
   to:
     org.javassist -> javassist 3.18.2.GA
   for example.
